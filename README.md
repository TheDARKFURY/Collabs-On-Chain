# C-Power
C-Power is a project focused on creating a new Contribution Power gating mechanism. This mechanism is designed to allow users to earn and accumulate ContributionPower(CPs), which can then be used to participate in Gated Communities, DAOS and governance decisions within the Solana ecosystem. The goal of this system is to create a more fair and transparent way for users to have a say in the direction of the project.
